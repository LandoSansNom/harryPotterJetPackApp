<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Harry Potter is one of the famous movie of all time. We like it a lot and we would certainly love to have a spot where we can discover all the Harry Potter characters together
That's why I build this app. It represents a space where:
* you can see all the characters from Harry Potter
* You have a detail page with specific information about each person who portrayed each character

I'll be adding more in the near future to complete the project. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
